  ## Installation

1. Fork the [repo](https://github.com/GAFelton/books-search-react-app).

2. Clone the repo to your local machine.

3. On your local repo, run `npm install` in the root folder to install npm packages from both package.json files.

4. Create a MongoDB database called `reactgooglebookssearch`, and make sure `mongod.exe` is running whenever you want to test the app locally.

5. Create a  file titled `.env` in the root folder. Inside it, you will include your Google Books API key. (Sign up for a key [here](https://console.developers.google.com/).)
   Format for .env file:

   ```
   BOOKS_API_KEY={your-secret-here}
   ```

6. Run `npm start` to start your node server, and visit `localhost:3000` to interact with Google Books Search.

  

  ## Usage
